Naming things
=============
March 29, 2015

**CodeJam** is the name I choose more than a year ago for both my domain
and [home server](../../2014/10/low-consumption-home-server.md)
name.

Choosing this name was tough. I wanted a name that evoked *programming*,
and possibly *free software*, while still being short and sounding
original.

Among all names I thought of, CodeJam was my favorite. "Code" is able
to evoke programming in just 4 letters, without being some kind of geeky
jargon. "Jam" was my musical touch.

A [jam session] is when a bunch of musicians get together and start
playing with very little or no preparation, like "let's just play
together and see where it leads". You have a lot of freedom in what you
play, but you still need to be consistent with the group. It's a very
rich creative process, and it decently picture my ultimate philosophy
with free software; let's just code together and see where it leads!

Turns out there's already something called *Google Code Jam*. Yeah,
Google, just that. If like me you didn't knew about it, it's a
competition created by Google for recruitment purposes.

How could I **not** find this before buying the domain (and in fact,
during the whole next year)? I don't know.

I discovered this while mentioning my blog on IRC, when someone replied
"Oh, I thought you were speaking about Google Code Jam". And I was like
"Wat?.. Holy shit!".

At first, I thought about changing my domain. It meant changing my
email, moving all the services I host at home: IRC, XMPP, mail server,
web server including my blog and personal page, and would have resulted
in a few dead links, unless I keep renewing `codejam.info` just to do
301's. And the hardest part: finding a *new* name.

So what?
--------

The thing is, I like this name. Except the fact that Google already use
it for its recruitment event, I believe it's a really good choice for
the reasons I evoked in the first part of this post.

After asking a few friends' opinions, and a night thinking about this
dilemma[^1], **I decided to keep CodeJam**. After all, Google Code Jam is not a
trademark and I don't care about my blog not being in the top results
when searching "CodeJam". Where's the problem then?

Long live CodeJam!
