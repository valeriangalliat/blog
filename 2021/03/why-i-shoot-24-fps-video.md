Why I shoot 24 FPS video
========================
March 6, 2021

I record video with a LX100, so keep in mind that with different gear,
your mileage may vary.

## Bitrate and bytes per frame

The LX100 offers the following recording options (I didn't include the
ones over 30 FPS as I'm not interested in those for this point).

* MP4 4K, 30 FPS, 100 Mbps
* MP4 4K, 24 FPS, 100 Mbps
* MP4 1080p, 30 FPS, 20 Mbps
* AVCHD 1080p 30 FPS, 24 Mbps
* AVCHD 1080p 24 FPS, 24 Mbps

If we bring it back down to the frame level, each frame is allowed
respectively:

* 3.3 MB (100 / 30)
* 4.1 MB (100 / 24)
* 0.6 MB (20 / 30)
* 0.8 MB (24 / 30)
* 1 MB (24 / 24)

You can see that with the options that the LX100 offers, by shooting 24
FPS instead of 30, we can allow more bytes for each frame, resulting in
an higher quality and more details overall (4.1 MB instead of
3.3 MB when comparing 4K MP4 for example).

### Note about 4K vs. 1080p

I wouldn't mind shooting in 1080p for the kind of work that I do, but
the quality of 1080p MP4 or AVCHD on this camera is not remotely as good
than 4K even if I later convert it down to 1080p.

Technically speaking, if I would downsize the 4K 24 FPS video by 4 to
output 1080p, and if I kept the bitrate proportional, each frame would
be allowed as much space than the AVCHD 1080p 24 FPS, but in reality,
I'm able to export in 1080p from the first one to an even lower bitrate
than the AVCHD version (15 Mbps) while having a nicer output (by orders
of magnitude). This is more likely because I'm able to use much better
compression algorithms in post that the LX100 can't afford to compute in
real time.

This means that even though 4K source video is pretty heavy, that's the
only way with this camera to get high quality video even when exporting
1080p at the end of the day.

The upside is that I can publish 1440p video on YouTube without
upscaling, and this has the benefit to force YouTube VP9 codec, which
gives a much better output than AVC1, which is otherwise used by default
for low views videos that are 1080p or less.

## Exposition

By taking less pictures per second, we can expose each frame longer,
which can be useful in low light situations.

That's another reason why I consistently shoot 24 FPS, so that I can
push the exposure longer than I could with 30 FPS, if I'm in a situation
that requires it.

## Slower slow motion

When I shoot, let's say, 60 FPS, I can slowdown the video up to 2.5
times when I put it in a 24 FPS timeline, while I can "only" slow it
down by a factor of 2 in a 30 FPS timeline.

Not a big deal, but might as well.

## Cinematic look (lol)

You probably heard many places online that by shooting 24FPS you get a
"cinematic" look. I don't really make the difference for the videos that
I make, to be honest, but i don't mind whatever looks it gives to my
videos either.

So mostly for all the advantages I listed above, but especially the fact
that I get higher image quality on the LX100, I prefer to shoot 24 FPS.
