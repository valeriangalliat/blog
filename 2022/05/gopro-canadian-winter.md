# Using a GoPro in the Canadian winter ❄️
May 25, 2022

If you ever used a GoPro in a very cold weather, I'm talking -20 or even -30 °C,
you probably noticed that its battery dies extremely fast. It's
sometimes a matter of *minutes* before it shuts off and refuses to start
again until it's warmed up again.

(any version especially after HERO4) dying ridiculously fast after being used

And it seems like it's [not just a problem with GoPro](https://forum.dji.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=252188).

> When the temperature is below -10 ℃, DJI Action 2 cannot be turned on.

There's a number of tips, lots of them that I'm not really read for.

You also see people putting it in a [foam cover](https://youtu.be/9SnPMeXVK3E)
or others [storing it in a bag](https://youtu.be/WK6oi7x_sNU) with [hand
or feet warmers](https://youtu.be/eeI7bTvlXyg) when not in use.

## The problem with the default case

I was actually surprised the first time I mounted the GoPro on my
helmet and I saw it die that fast. In the past I've used that same GoPro
hand-held, an I remember being able to shoot quite a lot, and still had
some battery left at the end of a ski day.

So what could be the culprit? Sure when it's mounted on my helmet I tend
to leave it outside a bit more, whereas before I would store it in my
pocket when it's not recording, but I've made a habit of taking it off
my helmet and putting it in my pocket during the lifts too, and still
had the same issues.

I've tried different pockets, jacket pocket, pants pocket, internal
pocket, but it wouldn't make much difference. It was always dead after a
few hours of being outside, regardless if I was recording a lot or
keeping it in my pocket most of the time.

One day, I've even kept the GoPro in my pants pocket (turned out to be
the warmest) for an hour or two before first using it, and it was
**already dead** when I tried to record! WTF?

So I decided to **try something** and just use it hand-held like I used
to in the previous years, to see if my battery degraded significantly
over time or something. **Turned out it performed great** and I could
shoot plenty of hand-held shots the whole day without it dying at any
point!

Then I realized: the *only* difference between that day where it died in
my pocket before I even use it, and that time where I could record
hand-held all day, was **the plastic case**.

When I plan to use it hand-held only, I don't put it in the black
plastic case that allows me to mount it.

* GoPro without case stored in pocket all day: **full battery**.
* GoPro with case stored in pocket all day: **battery dead after a
  couple hours**.

Luckily if you have a newer GoPro, you don't need a case to mount it
anymore, so this shouldn't be as much of a problem. But if using one of
the GoPro that can only be mounted with a case, it's a deal breaker!

## Introducing the Super Suit

The [Super Suit](https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX), alias "protection + dive
housing" and now renamed to ["protective housing + waterproof case"](https://amzn.to/3LMDaaa)
for the newer models, is a transparent waterproof case for your GoPro.

</figure>

It's designed to be used for diving under water, but as
[some users](https://www.hardcoresledder.com/threads/gopro-camera-stops-in-cold-weather.620282/post-20359482)
[pointed out](https://youtu.be/pXfNA-xqETA), it does a great job at
protecting from the cold too. It seems this is a very little known trick
for this problem!

I [ordered one](https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX) and was shocked of the
difference it made. **I was no longer running out of battery during the
day.**

I could record as much as I wanted at any time of the day and the GoPro
was always there and had plenty of battery life!

I don't record necessary *a lot* while I ski: between 30 minutes to 2
hours of content during a 6 hours ski day. Still, **before the Super
Suit, the GoPro would die in the first 2 hours of skiing**, regardless
of whether it was recording or stored in my pocket the whole time.

After the Super Suit, I can not only record **over 2 hours of content**,
but I can do so **over the course of the whole day**, as long as I keep
it in my pocket when it's not recording!

## Impact on audio

One of the known downsides of the waterproof housing is that it muffles
the audio. It *does* sound like it's inside a hermetic case.

This is a problem especially for voice: my own voice is somewhat audible
although not super crisp, but we can barely hear people talking around
me. This leads to some scenes where it sounds like I'm talking alone. 😂

But to be honest my HERO5 built-in audio has never been great, so if I
want to record somewhat usable vocals, I need to bring a real microphone
anyways. It seems that a lavalier microphone placed *inside* the collar
of a ski jacket is fantastic at recording your voice while skiing,
although I've never tried myself.

For the ambient sound though, I've found the muffled sound of the Super
Suit **perfect to cancel the wind while skiing**, so that we just hear
the skis gliding on the snow. This is in fact **much better** than what
we would otherwise get with the default case or no case (mostly wind,
skis not so much), and is actually usable as is!

I've also seen in [this video](https://youtu.be/pXfNA-xqETA) a setup
where they drilled tiny holes in the Super Suit around the different
GoPro microphones locations, and covered them with a wind muff. It seems
to give pretty solid results, but I don't have the tools to do that
myself, and I guess I like that I can actually use my Super Suit for
diving if I want to. 😄

## In short

GoPro dies in cold weather?

* Get a Super Suit, [Super Suit](https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX),
  alias ["protective housing + waterproof case"](https://amzn.to/3LMDaaa)
  for newer models.
* Keep the GoPro in your warmest pocket while not recording, don't let
  it turned off mounted on your helmet all day!
* Record voices with a lavalier microphone if you need quality dialogue.

I hope those tips help you to record more cool content while you're
outside in the cold winter! If you found this post useful, you might also
