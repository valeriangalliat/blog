Hi there! My name is **Val**. I wear many hats, and one of them is to be a
**backend software developer**.

| [Blog](https://www.codejam.info/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/valeriangalliat) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriangalliat/) | [Resume](https://valeriangalliat.github.io/cv/cv.en.pdf) | [Email](mailto:val@codejam.info) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|

I work the vast majority of the time with **JavaScript** and **Node.js**
which I've been using on a daily basis for the past **10 years**. I'll
happily work with **Python** as well.

I will write the [most simple](simple.md) solution to a problem,
and will only include abstractions, libraries or frameworks that are
**essential**. No reinventing the wheel, but even more importantly, **no
overengineering**.

The smoothest way to hand me off a task is by asking me to **write a
library** to solve it. Similarly to a package you would find on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), I'll write a
**custom package** to solve your problem. That package will be
**documented** and **tested** like you would expect most open source
package to be (unless you specifically ask me not to).

I charge **120 USD** per hour for private package development, or **100
USD** per hour for **open source packages** (published under any
[OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) of your choice).

[Send me an email](mailto:val@codejam.info) or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1292008346)
with a short description of your problem, and we'll discuss how I can
help you solve it. Cheers!
