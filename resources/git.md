Git
===

Last time I checked, `git` was *the* most used command in my history.
Git is one of the first software I install on a new machine, with
[Vim](vim.html).

Here's all the stuff I collected about Git, that helped me better
understand it and learn to use it properly.

### Personal notes

* Use `'` and not Markdown `` ` `` for consistency with default Git
  messages, like `Merge branch 'foo'`.

* For URLs, according to commit messages in Git itself and the Linux
  kernel, either skip a line and indent the URL with 4 spaces:

  ```
  Some message:

      https://www.codejam.info/

  Another sentence.
  ```

  or use link references like this:

  ```text
  Some message referencing a link [1] in a sentence, and maybe even
  another link [2].

  [1] https://www.codejam.info/
  [2] https://git.codejam.info/
  ```

Handling patches and pull requests
----------------------------------

* [Care And Operation Of Your Linus Torvalds](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
* [Gerrit Code Review - Signed-off-by Lines](http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html)
* [What is the Sign Off feature in Git for?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962094/what-is-the-sign-off-feature-in-git-for/14044024#14044024)
* ["Merge pull request" Considered Harmful](http://blog.spreedly.com/2014/06/24/merge-pull-request-considered-harmful/)

Especially, the part about "slightly modifying patches" in the first
three links:

> If you are a subsystem or branch maintainer, sometimes you need to
> slightly modify patches you receive in order to merge them, because
> the code is not exactly the same in your tree and the submitters'. If
> you stick strictly to rule *C*, you should ask the submitter to
> rediff, but this is a totally counter-productive waste of time and
> energy. Rule *B* allows you to adjust the code, but then it is very
> impolite to change one submitter's code and make him endorse your
> bugs. To solve this problem, it is recommended that you add a line
> between the last `Signed-off-by` header and yours, indicating the
> nature of your changes. While there is nothing mandatory about this,
> it seems like prepending the description with your mail and/or name,
> all enclosed in square brackets, is noticeable enough to make it
> obvious that you are responsible for last-minute changes. Example:
>
> ```
> Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
> [lucky@maintainer.example.org: struct foo moved from foo.c to foo.h]
> Signed-off-by: Lucky K Maintainer <lucky@maintainer.example.org>
> ```
>
> This practice is particularly helpful if you maintain a stable branch
> and want at the same time to credit the author, track changes, merge
> the fix, and protect the submitter from complaints. Note that under no
> circumstances can you change the author's identity (the `From`
> header), as it is the one which appears in the changelog.

So, in summary:

```
Commit summary

Longer description of the commit.

Closes #42.

[email@domain: fix summary]
[email@domain: fix summary that can be longer and span on multple lines
if needed, though it's still not capitalized nor have a period]
```

Clone the Linux kernel Git repository and search for `\[.*@` to see how
it's used.
