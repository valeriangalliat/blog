About

* Joined `#humanity` on July 20, 1995
* Spawned in Grenoble, France
* Currently in Montreal, Quebec

One of my favorite things in life is summiting mountains, whether it's
hiking, rock climbing or skiing. I usually bring a beer at the summit
(possibly homebrewed), which I not only love drinking, but also [taking
pictures of][beer] (but it's [not just about beer][photography], I like
taking pictures in general).

You'll often see me riding, whether it's on my [bike] or my [motorcycle].

I'm addicted to music, and when I'm not listening to some, I'm more
likely playing guitar, bass or synthesizer.

I also happen to be a software developer, currently working at
[Busbud].
