# Hello from the future
July 1, 2014

This post is a virtual first post, to indicate that this blog really
began in March 2015, with [this post](../../2015/03/coming-soon.md).

Everything published before is articles I planned to write, but didn't
wrote because I didn't have a blog yet. Once my blog opened, I started
to publish back this stuff in the past, because the original date was
more relevant, than the actual publication date.
