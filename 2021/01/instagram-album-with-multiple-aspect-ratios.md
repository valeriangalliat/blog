# Instagram album with multiple aspect ratios
January 30, 2021

Today I'm gonna share with you a tip to post multiple photos with different
aspect ratios (e.g. square, portrait, landscape) in the same Instagram post!

Here's an example of what you can achieve with this tip:

I've also shared this as a YouTube video, but keep reading if you want the text
version.

For the past while, my friend [Jimmy] have been posting albums on Instagram
(posts with multiple pictures) where some pictures have different aspect
ratios. Recently, I tried to do the same thing, and I realized the app wouldn't
let me do it.

By default your pictures are cropped as a square. You can click the "expand"
button to have it in portrait or landscape mode, but if you create a gallery
from this, all the pictures you add will then be cropped to the initial aspect
ratio. Meaning that if your first picture is a landscape and you then want to
add a square, your square will be cropped even more to fit in a landscape
frame.

It turns out to be able to use this "secret" feature, you have to use
[Facebook Creator Studio] to post your pictures, instead of using the app or the
website.

This tools allows you to post both on Facebook and Instagram at the same time,
or easily repost one of your Facebook posts to Instagram. But it also lets you
post just to Instagram, and when you do so, you have more freedom over the crop
and aspect ratio.

When you first log into the tool, you will be required to connect your
Instagram account to a Facebook page. If you don't have a Facebook page yet,
just create one, that you can mark as unpublished if you don't want it to be
public, and it will still let you link it and use the tool.

Once connected, you can go in the Instagram section of Facebook Creator Studio
and directly create new Instagram posts from there. The UI lets you select a
different crop / aspect ratio for each of the pictures you upload, so that when
you post it, they will all show up in their own native aspect ratio on the app.
Enjoy!
