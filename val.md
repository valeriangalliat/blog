About
-----

I'm from Grenoble, in the beautiful French Alps, and currently living in
Montreal, Canada.

One of my favorite things in life is summiting mountains, whether it's
hiking, rock climbing or skiing. I usually bring a beer at the summit
(possibly homebrewed), which I not only love drinking, but also [taking
pictures of][beer]. But it's [not just about beer][photography], I like
taking pictures in general.

You’ll often see me riding bikes, whether it's [with][motorcycle] or
[without][bike] an engine.

I'm addicted to music, and when I'm not listening to some, it's more
likely because I'm [playing][channel].

I also happen to be a software developer, currently working at
[Sportlogiq], and previously at [Busbud].
