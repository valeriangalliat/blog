<h1>MSI BIOS freeze on save and boot menu</h1>
<p>September 2, 2020</p>

<p>I’ve been having an issue on my rig for the past couple of months where
any time I go in the BIOS and go to the “Save &amp; Exit”, or any time I
open the boot menu, it just freezes and I need to reset. For reference,
my motherboard is a MSI H110M PRO-D.</p>
<p>This means I had no way of booting on something else than the default
boot priority, or to change any BIOS setting whatsoever.</p>
<p>I put it off for a while, but with the latest macOS update, I’ve had an
issue where it, well, wouldn’t update, and I figured it might be
related.</p>
<p>When looking up that issue, a common suggestion is to reset CMOS.</p>
<p>I was kinda lazy to open the computer and I mostly didn’t feel confident
about the procedure of shorting two pins that I wasn’t 100% sure which
ones it was, and was worried I would cause more harm than good doing so.</p>
<p>Meet “AUTO CLR_CMOS”.</p>
<h2 id="auto-clr-cmos"><a class="header-anchor" href="#auto-clr-cmos">¶</a> AUTO CLR_CMOS</h2>
<p>Turns out “Boot” menu in the BIOS setup contains an option named “AUTO
CLR_CMOS”. Enabling that gives access to another “Manual Mode” option,
that, when enabled, allows to reset CMOS by pressing the power button
for 6 seconds.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/2020/10/bios.jpg" alt="BIOS"></p>
<p>This seems promising, but one of the reasons I want to clear CMOS is
because I can’t save my BIOS settings as it freezes when I reach the
“Save &amp; Exit” menu.</p>
<h2 id="saving-bios-settings-without-going-to-the-save-menu"><a class="header-anchor" href="#saving-bios-settings-without-going-to-the-save-menu">¶</a> Saving BIOS settings without going to the save menu</h2>
<p>That day, I learnt that “in most BIOS” you can save the settings by
pressing F10. This worked for me, meaning that I didn’t have to go into
the save menu (that just freezes) to save the BIOS settings.</p>
<p>Thanks to that trick I could enable the “AUTO CLR_CMOS” “Manual Mode”.</p>
<p>With the computer off hold the power button. It will start, but as you
keep holding the button, after around 5 seconds, it shuts down again. It
seems that this triggered the reset of the CMOS (you can release at that
point).</p>
<p>Then wait 30 seconds or so (the power button had no effect for me during
that time, but it eventually works again).</p>
<p>On boot, you’ll get prompted to enter setup or continue, after what your
BIOS settings are reset to default.</p>
<p>Resetting CMOS that way effectively fixed the freezing issue (both on
the “Save &amp; Exit” menu as well as the boot menu) and I was able to
perform my update.</p>
