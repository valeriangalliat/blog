<h2 id="back-from-guadeloupe" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#back-from-guadeloupe"><span>Back from Guadeloupe</span></a></h2>
<p>Still living in Montreal. Spent a month working remote from Guadeloupe
from Christmas to the end of January with friends, including a week
sailing around the nearby islands! ⛵️</p>
<p>Tried kitesurfing for a few sessions, making progress but there’s still
quite some work until I can go upwind (the ultimate goal for me in
kitesurfing).</p>
<p>We also got to climb with Fred from <a href="https://www.gwadagrimpe.com/">Gwada Grimpe</a>,
a very inspiring guy who moved from Toronto to Guadeloupe and opened the
first climbing gym there, as well as and outdoor climbing association.
We got to do a first ascent on a new bouldering route that we named
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/chewichewiecroisieres/">Chéwi Chéwie</a>, after
the boat we sailed on in the beginning of the trip.</p>
<h2 id="working" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#working"><span>Working</span></a></h2>
<p>Left my job at <a href="https://hookdeck.com/">Hookdeck</a> at the end of December,
and still working at <a href="https://www.arcade.software/">Arcade</a>. I was doing
both (part-time) since August, and while this was a great challenge that
gave me no choice but learning to be extremely efficient and productive
in my work, it was also not sustainable long-term.</p>
<h2 id="skiing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#skiing"><span>Skiing</span></a></h2>
<p>After I came back from Guadeloupe, I dedicated my free time to skiing,
and in particular backcountry skiing with <a href="/gear.html#skiing">my new touring skis</a>.
I read <a href="https://www.diewithzerobook.com/">Die With Zero</a> recently and
that made me much more eager to use my time and money for this kind of
experiences, and especially do them while I’m young and in good shape.</p>
<h2 id="studying" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#studying"><span>Studying</span></a></h2>
<p>As always, I strive to dedicate a portion of my time studying things
that will improve my life and make me a better human being.</p>
<p>Currently, this involves the great <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/">Huberman podcast</a>,
where I already learnt a tremendous amount of information and tools that
had a major positive impact for me, and I feel like I only scratched the
surface.</p>
<p>I’m also curious about Jordan Peterson’s Maps of Meaning, and I’m
studying his 2017 lectures on YouTube. That’s 27 hours of content so
it’ll take a while before I get to the end of it. I’ve heard a lot of
good things about his work, as well as a lot of bad things, and I feel
like I can’t form my own educated opinion without properly studying the
material first.</p>
<p>I aim to watch about 15 minutes of either of those every day, in a
context where this is my sole focus, and I’m actively listening, and
pausing in order to take notes and reflect on the matters (so this takes
me much more than 15 minutes overall).</p>
<p>I also aim to read at least 30 minutes per day before bed, and I’m
currently reading Epictetus’ Discourses.</p>
<h2 id="writing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing"><span>Writing</span></a></h2>
<p>With now a single part-time job, and while the ski season is slowly
reaching its end here in Montreal, I’m able to dedicate a bit more of my
free time to writing.</p>
<p>I’ve been silent on the blog since last August because my free time has
been extremely sparse, and I’m looking forward to writing more now I
have a more reasonable work-life balance.</p>
<p>While I was not writing, I kept accumulating blog post ideas and I now
have a dozen of them to tackle! There’s some <em>really cool</em> stuff and I’m
excited to share them soon.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-think-of-the-now-page" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-you-think-of-the-now-page"><span>What do you think of the now page?</span></a></h2>
<p>This my first shot at a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>. Is it
useful?</p>
<p>This is somewhat similar to the “year in review” posts I used to do,
although I probably wasn’t supposed to write as much.</p>
<p>What I don’t like is that the content on the now page is ephemeral.
It’ll be mostly gone the next time I update it. Maybe I’ll keep some
kind of archive, although I’m not sure if that would really serve anyone.</p>
