Starting to brew beer: things I wish I knew
===========================================
June 8, 2019

Last year, I started to [brew beer](https://photography.codejam.info/2018/2018-11-26-brewing.html)
as a hobby with a friend. After [a couple of batches](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/sans-pression),
here's a small article to share some learnings from that experience so far.

Start with a 1 gallon kit
-------------------------

This might be the only thing we got straight right. If you never brewed
beer before, start with a 1 gallon kit (e.g. [a kit like this](https://www.beergrains.com/1-Gallon-Starter-Kit/)),
don't directly get into a bigger setup.

The reason for this is that it lets you experiment with brewing at a
very limited cost. If you decide you don't enjoy brewing that much, at
least you didn't invest hundreds of dollars into your equipment.

If you do want to keep on with brewing, you'll quickly notice that 1
gallon is not that much beer and will want to scale to 6 gallons
batches, possibly fermenting multiple of them at the same time.

However, the 1 gallon kit is never lost. It will always be handy to make
experimental batches, when you want to try different things and be more
creative without taking too much risk (as if it ends up to be
undrinkable, you didn't waste a lot), and when you're satisfied with
your experimental recipes, you can easily increase the quantities to
make bigger batches of them.

Get an auto-siphon
------------------

Maybe we just suck at using a regular siphon, but when trying to rack
the beer with it, it took many attempts to get the stream running, and
we ended up having to suck on the end of the tube to start the siphon,
and it would sometimes randomly stop and we'd have to reactivate it in
the same way, resulting in repeated mouth contact with the siphoning
tube (even after "sanitizing" your mouth with vodka as I sometimes see
advised online, I still would rather avoid this) and accidental spitting
into the beer as well. It still turned out good, but might as well not
do this kind of things.

To avoid this, just directly get an auto-siphon. It's trivial to use,
and you can effortlessly start the stream or give it a little boost if
it was to slow down.

Get a wort chiller
------------------

When you start doing more than 1 gallon (e.g. 6 gallons) batches, get a
wort chiller. It's somewhat pricey (count between $80 and $100 Canadian
for a 6 gallons one, regardless if you if you make it yourself or get a
premade one), but the time and energy it saves you is so worth it even
since the first time you use it.

Without a wort chiller, you can try to put the mash tun in the bath tub
with cold water, continuously throwing ice in the water to cool it down,
but even then it can take many hours to get the temperature down to a
point where it won't kill the yeast, while the wort chiller will get the
job done in 10 minutes without you having to do anything other than
opening the tap of cold water.

So do yourself a favor and get a wort chiller.

Get a grain filter basket
-------------------------

If you're gonna use the same mash tun to make your mash and to boil it,
you're gonna have to get rid of the grains and clean it up before
boiling.

Regardless if you're using a regular strainer or a bazooka filter,
you'll end up with a lot of grains in your mash tun which will take some
time to remove while your mash is just sitting there.

Instead, you can get a grain filter basket to put in the mash tun, so
that when you're done with the grains, you can just remove the filter
basket and the tun is instantly ready to use.

Then, as the boil is going, you can take the time to cleanup the grain
filter in parallel instead of it delaying the start of your boil.

Optional: use swing top bottles
-------------------------------

Swing top bottles are cool. Easy to open and close, no need for caps and
capper, plus they make a very nice *pop* when you open them. Guaranteed
effect in parties.
