<h1>About the name</h1>
<p>I got <a href="https://www.codejam.info/">codejam.info</a> years ago, with the idea
to build a tech blog to share tips, thoughts and resources about code.</p>
<p>You can check my article <a href="2015/03/naming-things.html">Naming things</a> for the full story behind it,
but in short, it was meant to associate the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session">jam session</a>
with programming.</p>
<h2 id="jam"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jam">¶</a> Jam</h2>
<p>A jam session essentially consists of people improvising music together,
regardless of their level and without necessarily knowing each other, in
a very spontaneous way, only agreeing on a very basic set of rules
(chords, tempo, time signature), and creating something unique and
beautiful.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful concept, and it resonates with my vision of
building software which is why CodeJam sounded like a perfect fit for my
blog.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-google-code-jam"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-about-google-code-jam">¶</a> What about Google Code Jam?</h2>
<p>I later learnt that this name was already used by Google, for the Google
Code Jam international programming competition, which is unfortunate,
but I kept that name since I still believe in the message it symbolizes.</p>
<h2 id="jamming-further-than-code"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jamming-further-than-code">¶</a> Jamming further than code</h2>
<p>It turns out that with time, my interests shifted from being solely
centered on programming and I now use that same domain name to share
plenty of different things that I’m passionate about, whether it’s
photography, music, sports, brewing and so on, so it’s now more about
the “jam” than the “code”.</p>
<p>I also realized that the powerful concept of the musical jam session not
only vibed with my approach to programming, but also with my approach to
life (just that), where I like to create environments where a diverse
group of people can spontaneously get together and feel like expressing
themselves freely, allowing unique and beautiful things to happen.</p>
