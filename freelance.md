Hi there! My name is **Val**. I wear many hats, and one of them is to be a
**backend software developer**.

| [Blog](https://www.codejam.info/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/valeriangalliat) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriangalliat/) | [Resume](https://valeriangalliat.github.io/cv/cv.en.pdf) | [Email](mailto:val@codejam.info) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|

I'm currently available for short freelancing projects of 2 weeks or
less.

## Expertise

My specialities are *scraping websites*, *documenting undocumented
APIs*, *integrating third-party services* and *deploying code to the
"cloud"*.

I work the vast majority of the time with **JavaScript** and **Node.js**
which I've been using on a daily basis for the past **10 years**. I'll
happily work with **Python** and **Elixir** as well.

## Philosophy

I will write the [most simple](simple.md) solution to a problem,
and will only include abstractions, libraries or frameworks that are
**essential**. No reinventing the wheel, but even more importantly, **no
overengineering**.

No matter how complex the task at hand, my main success metric is when
the code I wrote can be **read and maintained** by a junior developer.

## Flow

The smoothest way to hand me off a task is by asking me to **write a
library** to solve it. Similarly to a package you would find on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), I'll write a **custom package** to solve
your problem. That package will be **documented** and **tested** like
you would expect most open source package to be (unless you specifically
ask me not to).

If relevant, I'll split my work in **multiple small pull requests** so
you get a chance to review the code and give me feedback early on. This
might increase the overall time to completion depending on your
reactivity, but will definitely reduce the hours that you *pay for*.

## Quote

I charge **120 USD** per hour for private package development, or **100
USD** per hour for **open source packages** (published under any
[OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) of your choice).

**Ask me for a quote!** If your problem falls in my **area of
expertise**, you might be surprised that my time estimate will be a
fraction of that of your average developer.

[Send me an email](mailto:val@codejam.info) or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1292008346)
with a short description of your problem, and we'll discuss how I can
help you solve it. Cheers!
