If you backup your phone photos to Google Photos automatically, and you
don't pay for some kind of Google One subscription, you'll run sooner or
later into the 15 GB storage limit of your Google account.

15 GB is not a lot, especially when you consider than my Pixel 6a takes
pictures that are easily 3 to 5 MB each. ðŸ˜¬

To be fair, if you want convenience and you value your time, Google
One's $20/year for 100 GB is a pretty damn good deal. Same goes for the
higher options with more storage if you need.

But if you don't like recurring bills like me, and you find it overkill
to keep that many old photos in the cloud, read on.

## My protocol for archiving photos away from Google

In order to save space, I'll periodically archive my old photos outside
of Google Photos.

This protocol is designed to archive photos _from the phone_ that are
_backed up_ to Google Photos, but preserving the phone's original
arborescence. Google Photos doesn't have the path information, only the
filename, so backing up _from Google Photos_ directly would not work for
this use case.

The downside is that this doesn't cover the case where you have photos
in Google Photos that are _not_ on your phone.

Also it's designed for a single phone backing up to a Google Photos
account that's used _solely_ for that device. Multiple devices sharing
the same Google Photos is not supported.

With that said, here's how I do it.

### 1. Sync phone to computer

First, I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync the contents of
my phone to my computer.

I configure Syncthing as "send only" on my phone, and "receive only" on
my computer, and I configure it to sync the root directory of my phone
(which can be tricky, [but possible](syncthing-root-directory.md)).

**After the sync is complete, I turn off Syncthing from my computer, to
make sure no incremental updates will happen during the archive
process.**

### 2. Double check I'm not missing anything

If some photos are _only_ on Google Photos but not stored on the phone,
the previous step didn't archive them. We need to make sure to download
them from Google Photos in the first place.

Because there's no way from Google Photos to find all photos that are
not locally saved to a specific device (other than going through them
one by one), that's where I use the Google Photos API to make sure I'm
not missing anything.

This will get technical, so if you don't care about this part, feel free
to skip to [the next step](#3-copy-synced-folder-to-archive).

First, we need a Google OAuth token with access to Google Photos. We'll
reuse [my script from this other article](../../2021/02/google-oauth-from-cli-application.md#update-local-server-redirect)
for this, just replacing the scope with `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.readonly`.
Put it in a `token.mjs` file and run it with `node token.mjs`, this will
go through the OAuth process and after you complete the authentication,
will log the access token that we'll use in the next script.

The following script can go in `photos.mjs` and be run with `node
photos.mjs`, reusing the token from the previous step.

```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises'

const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

let pageToken = ''
let pages = []

do {
  const url = 'https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems?pageSize=100&pageToken=' + encodeURIComponent(pageToken)

  console.log(url)

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  })

  const json = await response.json()

  pages.push(json)

  pageToken = json.nextPageToken
} while (pageToken)

await fs.writeFile('pages.json', JSON.stringify(pages, null, 2))
```

This will fetch all pages from the Google Photos API and dump them in a
`pages.json` file.

From there, I like to use [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to extract
the filenames:

```sh
cat pages.json | jq -r '.[].mediaItems[].filename' | sort > gphoto-files
```

Now, let's make a list of all the files local to the phone. I'll only
scan the directories I configured to be backed up on Google Photos.
Adjust this to your needs.

```sh
find DCIM Pictures Movies Download \( -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.jpeg' -o -name '*.mp4' -o -name '*.png' -o -name '*.webp' \) > ~/phone-files
cat phone-files | xargs basename | sort > phone-basefiles
```

<div class="note">

**Note:** to find the list of relevant extensions I used the following command:

```sh
cat gphoto-files | awk -F. '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq
```

</div>

Now we have a sorted list of the files on Google Photos and on the
phone, we can use the `comm` command to find missing entries:

```sh
# See what's on the phone but not on Google Photos
comm -23 phone-basefiles gphoto-files

# See what's on Google Photos but not on the phone
comm -23 gphoto-files phone-basefiles
```

If I'm missing some files, I'll go on and download them from Google
Photos to my phone and run the sync again, and repeat this process until
everything is consistent.

When a file is missing from the phone, look at `pages.json` to find the
corresponding Google Photos link!

<div class="note">

**Note:** here's an alternative script I've also been using to check if
the files from Google Photos are missing in my backup:

```sh
cat gphoto-files | while read file; do find . -name "$file" | grep -q . || echo "Missing $file"; done
```

</div>

### 3. Copy synced folder to archive

For this example, let's assume I synced my phone to a
`/Volumes/Syncthing/Phone` directory, and I want to archive my old
photos in `/Volumes/Archive/Phone`.

I'll run the following command to copy the phone contents to my archive
directory (but copying from Finder also works). Here I'm only copying
the directories I configured to be backed up to Google Photos in the
first place.

```sh
mkdir -p /Volumes/Archive/Phone
cp -a /Volumes/Syncthing/Phone/{DCIM,Pictures,Movies,Download} /Volumes/Archive/Phone
```

If the target directory already exists, this will append new files to it
(and overwrite them if a file already exists there)!

<div class="note">

**Note:** if both directories are on the same filesystem, and you're not
appending to an existing archive, you may use `mv` instead, but then
make sure to recreate the Syncthing directory and put back its
`.stfolder` (required for Syncthing to recognize it) and `.stignore` if
you have one!

</div>

At that point I like to remove empty directories from the archive. This
also involves removing `.DS_Store` files on Mac, and `.nomedia` if you
use WhatsApp, to make sure the empty directories can actually be
identified as such.

```sh
find . -type f -name .nomedia -delete
find . -type f -name .DS_Store -delete
find . -type d -empty | while read dir; do rmdir -v "$dir"; done
```

The last command is not recursive so you may need to run it a few times
in the case a parent directory only contained empty directories. It's
done when it outputs nothing.

### 4. Delete everything from Google Photos

Not necessarily everything, but well, everything you want to delete to
free up space.

You can do it from your phone, or from Google Photos on your computer,
or on the web, although in my experience, **I would recommend doing it
from the phone**.

When deleting _a lot_ of photos from the web version, this tends to
confuse the phone's syncing algorithm and I've ended up with a bunch of
photos being re-uploaded and somehow duplicated and it was kind of a
mess to clean up.

It tends to _just work_ when deleting from the phone. The only downside
is that the app doesn't make it easy to select a whole bunch of photos
at once, I just have to hold my thumb for a minute with the super slow
scroll until everything is selected.

<div class="note">

**Note:** at that point I like to take note of how many photos I
deleted, so I can double check the number in a later step.

</div>

### 5. Sync phone to computer again

Again with Syncthing in my case, I do a sync following the deletion.

<div class="note">

**Note:** you may want to exclude `.trashed-*` files in your
`.stignore`, otherwise the photos you deleted will still be transferred
while they're in the trash.

</div>

Now in our example, `/Volumes/Syncthing/Phone` contains just the
photos we decided to keep around in Google Photos, while
`/Volumes/Archive/Phone` contains _all_ the photos (also including the
ones we kept around).

### 6. Remove the overlap

To avoid that duplication, we can remove all files from the archive that
are still in the Syncthing directory. That is, all the photos/videos we
kept, as well as all the files in the phone storage that are not managed
by Google Photos.

```sh
(cd /Volumes/Syncthing/Phone && find . -type f) | while read f; do
  file="/Volumes/Archive/Phone/$f"

  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    rm -v "$file"
  fi
done
```

Now, the archive directory only contains what we removed from Google
Photos (and from the phone).

We can confirm with the following command:

```sh
find /Volumes/Archive/Phone -type f | grep -v DS_Store | wc -l
```

It should match the number of files deleted from Google Photos earlier.

We can also one last check:

```sh
find /Volumes/Syncthing/Phone/{DCIM,Pictures,Movies,Download} \( -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.jpeg' -o -name '*.mp4' -o -name '*.png' -o -name '*.webp' \) | wc -l
```

This should match the number of photos _currently_ on Google Photos (if
you kept any).

### 7. Profit!

You can now enjoy all the space you freed up by archiving your photos
and videos away from Google Photos!

Repeat every time you're close to running out of storage. ðŸ˜‰

## What about motion photos?

Google's motion photos are the equivalent of Apple's live photos: a
photo that also contains a short video of the "moment" it was captured.

What happens to those during our archival process? Well, it's
complicated.

In short, don't worry, they're backed up and the little video that goes
with the motion photo is not going to be lost, but you won't be able to
watch the "live" part anymore, you'll only see the still picture.

The reason is that Google stores the MP4 video part at the end of the JPEG
file. This doesn't prevent displaying the image, but there's currently
no photo viewer other than Google Photos that knows to extract that MP4
section following the JPEG data, and display it properly.

So if you want to see the live part of a motion photo, you'll have to
re-import it to Google Photos.

Alternatively, you can extract the MP4 part of the motion photo to a
different file, which you can do by using a script like
[detailed in this post](https://mjanja.ch/2021/10/stripping-embedded-mp4s-out-of-android-12-motion-photos/).

<div class="note">

**Note:** if you use the script from the above post on macOS, you'll
need GNU `grep` in order find the byte offset of the MP4 header.

This means you'll have to `brew install coreutils` and replace `grep` by
`ggrep` in the script for it to work.

</div>

## Conclusion

Archiving photos away from Google Photos is not trivial, but possible.

If you care about not losing any of your photos, I recommend double
checking at every step that you're not accidentally forgetting any file.

When done well, this allows to periodically free up some space from your
Google account without actually having to get rid of your photos and
videos! They'll still be available on your archive hard drive if you
want to. Your old photos are not as handy as if they were in the cloud,
but you know you can access them if needed.

Overall, you're probably better off just paying Google to increase your
storage, but if you're really motivated, I hope you can find inspiration
in the process I described in this post.
