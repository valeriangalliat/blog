# What strings for BeaverCreek travel size acoustic electric guitar
January 22, 2021

A couple months ago, I bought a [BeaverCreek travel size guitar][guitar]!

I even made a review of it on YouTube, check it out:

It's a cool guitar, and after 6 months, it's about time for me to change
the strings. However since it's a pretty unconventional size guitar, I
was unsure what gauge to get.

I couldn't find anything online about what strings it came with out of
the box, the BeaverCreek website only says "D'Addario strings", and none
of the retailer websites mention the gauge either.

So I contacted BeaverCreek from their website, and Nigel answered me
with all the details about the strings! Since I think this is valuable
information that should be easier to find online, I'll copy his answer
here!

> Thanks for contacting BeaverCreek Instruments.
>
> Our travel size guitars are strung and shipped with D’Addario EXP16. \
> These are a light gauge (12-53) coated phosphor bronze string for
> longer lasting tone and playability.
>
> The EXP product line has been upgraded and the new equivalent is called XT. \
> EXP strings may still be available from your local retailer. \
> The standard light gauge EJ16 is also a great choice for this guitar.
>
> Here are the product numbers to look for:
>
> * [EXP16] (12-53) coated light gauge - phosphor bronze
> * [XTAPB1253] (NEW!) (12-53) coated light gauge - phosphor bronze
> * [EJ16] (12-53) uncoated light gauge - phosphor bronze
>
> Sincerely,

Thank you Nigel! ✌️
