<p>I bought this workstation on <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/570386-REG/On_Stage_WS7500RB_WS7500_Studio_Workstation_Rosewood.html">B&amp;H</a>
a couple weeks ago, and I just love it! So I‚Äôm gonna tell you everything
I like about it in this article, as I found there‚Äôs not a lot of content
about it online. I wrote mostly the same review on B&amp;H, but I‚Äôve got
some extra formatting here. üòõ</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-get-that-workstation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-i-get-that-workstation"><span>Why did I get that workstation?</span></a></h2>
<p>First, I got this workstation to be able to have both my computer
keyboard and my synth in front of me when producing, which is something
I couldn‚Äôt do with my former ‚Äúregular‚Äù desk (not as deep, and no
shelving) and the WS7500 does a fantastic job at that.</p>
<h2 id="real-estate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#real-estate"><span>Real estate</span></a></h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt even use the keyboard tray for the keyboard as I find it a
bit too low for me so I just use it as extra storage, but the fact
there‚Äôs an upper platform for the screen and such gives me <em>so much
room</em> that I can put both the synth and the computer keyboard in front
of me on the main surface.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have some felt pads under my synth which makes it just high
enough for my keyboard wire to go under it, leaving me with a super neat
and clean setup.</p>
</div>
<p>The upper platform is pretty big as well, I can easily fit my 23&quot; screen
as well as 2 studio monitors. I was worried it would be a bit cramped there but it‚Äôs not! And it‚Äôs
pretty deep as well so I still have plenty of room on the top platform
to put random stuff there if I need to.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>
<p>I like that there is two possible positions for the upper platform
(closer or further back). I put it closer to me because I‚Äôm in a pretty
small space, but if you have the room, you can put it further back so it
opens up a bit more the main surface.</p>
<h2 id="assembly" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#assembly"><span>Assembly</span></a></h2>
<p>It was pretty straightforward to build, only the keyboard tray required
me to think a bit but the rest was dead simple. And I could mount it by
myself, no extra help needed!</p>
<h2 id="look" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#look"><span>Look</span></a></h2>
<p>I really like the color, I find that it looks even better in real life
than on the product photos.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs some tiny imperfections on the surface, notably two minor bumps
on the right side of the main surface, and two super small ‚Äúclear‚Äù spot
on the wood texture on the left and front edges of the top surface.</p>
<p>So yeah, it‚Äôs not 100% perfect, just 99.9% perfect. That‚Äôs fine with me,
especially for the price. Well, about price.</p>
<h2 id="price" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#price"><span>Price</span></a></h2>
<p>I bought it from B&amp;H for 214.95 USD, with free shipping and 45.54 USD of
prepaid duties and taxes. That made a total of 260.49 USD, which was 352.93
CAD at the time I bought it.</p>
<p>At that price, that‚Äôs the cheapest workstation of its kind that I could
find online.</p>
<p>That said it seems that the base level for this kind of workstation on
the market is pretty high in the first place, as even the cheapest one
is solid AF and really delivers (and is not like super cheap either, if
you consider that I buy most of my furniture from Ikea or Amazon, which
makes this desk one of the most expensive piece of furniture that I
own, and it was 100% worth it).</p>
<p>Also major props to B&amp;H for allowing me to prepay the duties and taxes,
so I could just forget about it after ordering, and which likely made
the shipping faster. Well, about shipping.</p>
<h2 id="shipping" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shipping"><span>Shipping</span></a></h2>
<p>Lastly, it shipped and arrived super fast even though it ships from the
US (for free!) and I‚Äôm in Canada, so that was a great surprise, kudos to
B&amp;H for that!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2>
<p>This workstation is fucking awesome, I love it.</p>
