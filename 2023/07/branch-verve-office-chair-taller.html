<h1>Branch Verve office chair: make it taller!</h1>

<p>I recently bought the <a href="https://www.branchfurniture.ca/products/verve-chair">Verve chair</a>
by Branch as an upgrade for my office. It was quite pricey, but not
Herman Miller pricey, and it‚Äôs really comfortable.</p>
<p>Before that, I was sitting on the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/jaervfjaellet-office-chair-with-armrests-grann-white-70521855/">J√ÑRVFJ√ÑLLET chair from Ikea</a>,
and to be fair, for half the price of the Verve chair, it was easily 80%
of the comfort. I had no trouble sitting on it all day long, and that‚Äôs
even without putting the armrests because I like to play guitar!</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, I‚Äôve had only one complaint about the Verve chair: it‚Äôs too
short!</strong> Its highest setting is still pretty low, and that just doesn‚Äôt
cut it for 1. me being a tall guy and 2. my workstation being a tad
higher than your typical office desk.</p>
<p>Quite a number of reviews did mention that issue, but you know how it
is, I only searched the reviews for that particular problem once I
encountered it. üò¨</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-the-chair-taller" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-make-the-chair-taller"><span>How to make the chair taller</span></a></h2>
<p>As far as I know, this is gonna be applicable to pretty much any office
chair. <strong>The best thing you can do is replace the gas cylinder for a
taller one.</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, this seems to be standard, and the Verve chair was no
exception. I‚Äôve got <a href="https://amzn.to/455kzjv">one off Amazon</a>. Pretty
much any replacement ones I browsed through were taller than the one
that came with the chair, and tall enough for me. Double check the size
for your particular situation though!</p>
<p>In order to replace the cylinder, I also had to buy a
<a href="https://amzn.to/44BRIDD">mallet</a> in order to pop the old one out
without damaging it. (Really, get a mallet if you don‚Äôt have one, I
struggled pretty hard with a hammer and couldn‚Äôt get it out, then a
single tap with the mallet once I got it got the job done.)</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also got some <a href="https://amzn.to/3Y9d3lr">replacement casters with brakes</a>
because <a href="../../2021/01/ikea-office-chair-lock-wheels-uneven-floor.html">my floor is still slanted</a>.
If even with a new cylinder your chair is not tall enough, you can
consider getting some those <a href="https://amzn.to/3OxpnbT">rollerblade-style casters</a>
that are gonna be taller than standard wheels, and apparently have a
bunch of advantages like not damaging floors, working better on carpets,
and being smoother in general, and obviously a sick look. Although I
didn‚Äôt get to try them yet.</p>

<p>In the beginning I was so disappointed to find that I couldn‚Äôt use my
brand new chair because it was too short, but at the end of the day it
was actually pretty easy to fix. A $30 replacement gas cylinder and a
cheap mallet got the job done in no time.</p>
<p>That being said, given the price of the chair,  I wish I didn‚Äôt have to
go through that extra trouble.</p>
