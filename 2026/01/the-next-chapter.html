<p>I’m well settled in Squamish now. Two years already!</p>
<p>As an introvert and working remote, it was a bit of a slow start
rebuilding social circles from scratch. It really takes being
intentional about it. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/southcoasttouring/">Facebook</a>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1322245267842175/">groups</a> and the
<a href="https://getoak.app/">Oak app</a> are pretty sweet, and believe it or not,
talking to strangers <abbr title="In real life">IRL</abbr> also works!
The good thing is that the more people you know, the more people you
meet, so it gets pretty effortless over time.</p>

<p>In 2025 I’ve been out in the mountains like crazy, and hit 130,000
meters of elevation gain all sports combined (ski touring, trail
running, gravel and mountain biking). It’s my biggest elevation gain
year lifetime, 30,000 meters more than 2024. 💪</p>
<p>That includes scrambling Sky Pilot, climbing Star Check (3 times lol),
Cloudburst, Goat Ridge scramble, Blackcomb Peak ridge scramble, a
marathon to Castle Towers, Gentian Peak and Panorama Ridge, Ossa
Mountain, Rainbow Mountain, the Armchair Traverse (Mount Cook and Mount
Weart), Locomotive Mountain and its loop scramble, Coliseum Mountain,
and finishing with the Howe Sound Crest Trail (with extra Harvey,
Brunswick and West Lion lol get rekt). What a year!</p>

<h2 id="about-part-time-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#about-part-time-work"><span>About part-time work</span></a></h2>
<p>If you’re wondering how I go in the mountains that much, you need to
know I’ve been working part-time as a software contractor since 2021.
Going part-time was the best thing I’ve ever done in my career (other
than connecting a ping-pong table to the internet 🏓) and I’m incredibly
grateful to have worked with companies who gave me that opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe I should write more about this because it’s still really uncommon
in the industry, but believe it or not, <strong>those years have also been the
most productive of my career</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s definitely a combination of factors. Despite working only 20 hours
a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m naturally more experienced now than I was years ago.</li>
<li>I have been intentional about working with small companies (read: less
than 10 people) where I can have a sizable impact, without being
slowed down by corporate friction, processes and politics.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s law</a> is a thing (“work expands so as to fill the time available”).</li>
<li>And of course since a few years and increasingly, using AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, this means that there’s a sweet spot for time-to-productivity
ratio, especially when it comes to creative work like building software,
and in many cases I’m not convinced that it’s at or above 40 hours.</p>

Breton and particularly ride the Cabot Trail on my friend’s road bike
that I borrowed. Around 300 km and 3,000 meters of elevation that I
split in two days. It was beautiful.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-jump" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-big-jump"><span>The big jump 🏃</span></a></h2>
<p>Remember how I was writing about part-time work earlier? Well all good
things have an end, and this was not an option anymore at the company I
had been working until then.</p>
<p>Going full-time right before ski season didn’t feel exactly right, and
it really felt like a sign for me to 1. take some proper time off and 2.
get out of my comfort zone and try something a bit scarier.</p>
<p>The time off consisted of a fuckton of climbing, then skiing. Being in
BC, we eventually got a few of the usual warm storms where it rains all
the way to the top of mountains and destroy the skiing conditions until
it snows again. <strong>This gave me some solid windows to start building
again.</strong></p>
<p>We got together with my friend <a href="https://www.benoitzohar.com/">Ben</a> and
started <a href="https://evetools.app/">EveTools</a>, where we make apps for
developers.</p>
<p>The first app is <a href="https://flame.evetools.app/">Flame</a>, and its goal is
to remove as much friction as possible from the Firebase local
development experience, especially when it comes to dealing with the
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite">emulators</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been working with Firebase quite extensively for over 3 years now,
so we have a pretty good understanding of the pain points of the current
experience. There’s a lot to do, and I hope we can have a positive
impact on that platform.</p>
<figure class="center">
  <img alt="Flame" srcset="../../img/2026/01/now/flame.webp 2x" loading="lazy">
</figure>
<p>At the time of writing it’s in private beta, but we’re planning on
opening it up pretty soon! If you find about Flame via this post,
<a href="/val.html#contact">shoot me an email</a> and I’ll send you a discount! 🫶</p>
<hr>
<p>Two interesting realizations since this happened.</p>
<h3 id="buildingception" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#buildingception"><span>Buildingception</span></a></h3>
<p>First, building a product, and doing so end to end (read: not just the
tech), reveals <em>a lot</em> more pain points and problems to be solved. Some
specific to the stack we work with, and some broader ones too. And the
good news is, a lot of them can be solved with more tech!</p>
<p>In other words, the more I build, the more ideas I get about what to
build next.</p>
<p>Granted it’s not the best way to source ideas if you’re optimizing for
maximum revenue, but it seems to be doing a decent job at optimizing for
maximum motivation, and I do enjoy that for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="so-much-for-part-time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#so-much-for-part-time"><span>So much for part-time</span></a></h3>
<p>Second, is that despite advocating for the benefits of part-time work
for the past 4 years, including higher up in this article, I’m actually
having a <em>really</em> good time working every single day right now, weekends
included. <strong>Working on your own thing does hit different.</strong></p>
<p>I hope my fellow coastal BC skiers don’t read this, but I’m lowkey
grateful for this rain-into-dry-spell event a few weeks ago, so that I
feel no guilt and <abbr title="Fear of missing out">FOMO</abbr>
to be so much on my laptop.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I still believe in part-time work, and in fact, being an
independent developer is my current best bet on building that lifestyle
back one day or another. But it also seems like a futile dream until I
generate any sustainable income.</p>
<p>Let’s see where the snow takes me…</p>
<h2 id="on-coffee" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#on-coffee"><span>On coffee ☕️</span></a></h2>
<p>I’m back to drinking caffeine, after years of being on decaf. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>Seems to pair well with the business hustling for now. We’ll see if I
build up a tolerance again. If it stops being a net positive I’ll
readjust.</p>
<p>And weirdly, after being into specialty coffee for years (read: small
batch micro roaster beans I weigh and grind before brewing), I’m back
with my moka pot and sous vide Italian pre-ground. Who would have
thought?</p>

was no important update to write about, which is probably why I didn’t

<p>Of course, the usual local mountain adventures. Including skiing

<p>Went to Jackson Hole for a work retreat, and took some extra time off
there to explore the mountains and do a lot of road and gravel biking,
including riding around Yellowstone, with a colleague who’s an absolute
triathlon machine. Those few weeks are probably the most volume I’ve
done in a continuous stretch to this day, although the Andorra trip from
last year was a close contender.</p>

<p>Putting together all those photos is pretty time consuming, but honestly
it feels valuable to take that time to reflect on the past and really
appreciate everything that I experienced.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the fast paced train of life and never
take a step back to contemplate the big picture. Those “now page”
updates help me do exactly that.</p>
