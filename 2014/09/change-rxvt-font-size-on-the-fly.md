Change rxvt font size on the fly
================================
September 18, 2014

Ever wanted to change the terminal font size (or even font family) on
the fly when using rxvt? This is easy!

```sh
printf '\33]50;%s%d\007' "xft:monospace:size=" "$size"
```

Replace `$size` with the size of your choice.

I even made [a little script][fz] to ease this, called `fz`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# Dynamically change font size in rxvt.
#

# Tweak this with your own font settings
readonly PREFIX='xft:monospace:size='

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo 'Usage: fz <size>'
    exit 1
fi

printf '\33]50;%s%d\007' "$PREFIX" "$1"
```
