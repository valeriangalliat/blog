<h1>Hello from the future</h1>
<p>July 01, 2014</p>
<p>This post is a virtual first post, to indicate that this blog really
began in March 2015, with <a href="../../2015/03/coming-soon.html">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Everything published before is articles I planned to write, but didn’t
wrote because I didn’t have a blog yet. Once my blog opened, I started
to publish back this stuff in the past, because the original date was
more relevant, than the actual publication date.</p>
