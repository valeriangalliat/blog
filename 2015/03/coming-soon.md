Coming soon

Coming soon. This is what I wrote like 10 months ago next to the "Blog"
section of my [personal home page][] <small>(no, this article is not
about PHP)</small>.

[personal home page]: https://val.codejam.info/

Well, since I know myself well enough, I originally added a `title`
attribute saying: "Between 1 week and 1 year, maybe". According to the
date of this very post, it's needless to say it was more one year than
one week.

The need for a blog
-------------------

It's been a while I'm periodically thinking: "I should definitely write
a blog". It often happens when I want to share how-tos, interesting
stuff or thoughts, about programming, Unix systems, networking, or
computing in general.

Meanwhile, I kept these ideas as text files in my `todo` directory,
because:

1. I need them for myself ("how did I do this already?").
1. I planned to share them in the future.

According to `ls todo/blog | wc -l`, I currently have 102 items in
there. Nearly one year of accumulated stuff, mostly really small
how-tos, and collections of interesting links.

There's also a bunch of ideas I don't think worth a blog article, or are
not relevant anymore. **IT is moving fast, and things can become
obsolete in less than a year (well, especially on the Web).**

Anyway, in the following days (or months, [if you begin to know me][sp]),
I'll try to publish most of these resources on this blog.  Since I have
the precise creation date of every single file in my `todo` directory,
I'll publish them **in the past**. Because I can.

Prose? Yet another programming language?
----------------------------------------

I use to write *for computers*[^1]. Will I write well enough *for
humans*?

Writing a blog is for sure really different from writing code and
technical documentation. I need to get used to it. Feel free to [contact
me][contact] if you have any comment or advice to give me!

[^1]: This is not exactly true, because I try my best to make my code
*also* understandable by other people. But you get the idea.
