    acoustic instruments as well as vlogs when mounted on top of my
    camera. It's probably not the very best at any of those categories
    but it delivers solid results for all of them which is quite

    <td>The camera I use for everything! It's small and lightweight
    yet has the biggest sensor you can find on a compact camera (Micro
    Four Thirds as opposed to 1 inch for the majority of compact
    cameras). Allows to get more light in for higher image quality and
    low light response. Easily carryable, I always take it with me
    strapped around my side while I hike so I can draw it in a matter
    of seconds if I want to capture something. All the pictures you
    can see on my <a href="https://photography.codejam.info/">photograpy website</a>
    are taken with it. You can also check out the
    <a href="2020/05/my-settings-for-panasonic-lumix-lx100.html">settings I use</a>

    <td><a href="https://amzn.to/3dL1QRu">Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX100K</a></td>
    <td>I just mentioned it in the photo category, but this also does
    an awesome job at video! It can shoot 4K (albeit not at 60 FPS)
    which looks especially crisp when scaled down to 1080p or 1440p
    for YouTube and allows for some cropping margin in post without
    losing quality. Because it's small and lightweight it's convenient
    to vlog with, especially with the hot shoe mount that
    allows adding a microphone on top (that said it doesn't have a
    mini jack input so you have to record and sync the audio
    separately). Here's the <a href="2020/05/my-settings-for-panasonic-lumix-lx100.html">settings I use</a>

    because otherwise the strap rubbing and shaking around when I move
    is picked up by the microphone. With this I can just remove the
    strap in a few seconds when I want to vlog! I initially considered
    the <a href="https://amzn.to/31SMN5z">Peak Design Leash</a> for that
