<p>If you ever used a GoPro in a very cold weather, I’m talking -20 or even -30 °C,
you probably noticed that its battery dies extremely fast. It’s
sometimes a matter of <em>minutes</em> before it shuts off and refuses to start

(any version especially after HERO4) dying ridiculously fast after being used
in cold weather, e.g. with winter sports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any conditions below 20 °F / -10 °C my GoPro HERO8 renders itself
utterly useless with the battery dying after about 10 minutes of
filming.

<p>I am skiing right now with a GoPro max. I can’t even take it outside before it dies. 6-7 degrees below Celsius.
[<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/kd48w1/gopro_hero_9_turns_off_at_cold_temperatures/">Source</a>]</p>
<p>Found the same problem on my HERO8 Black. Tested in -27 here in Norway and it died immediately after 2-3 clips.
[<a href="https://youtu.be/FlqLFW9DZVk">Source</a>]</p>
<p>Battery life has been a real pain for me as well using it during the
winter months. I keep my camera and batteries in my pants pockets
until I need them but even doing that might yield me five minutes of
recording once it’s exposed to sub-zero temps.

<p>And it seems like it’s <a href="https://forum.dji.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=252188">not just a problem with GoPro</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the temperature is below -10 ℃, DJI Action 2 cannot be turned on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a number of tips, lots of them that I’m not really read for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you finish your line, stop and take the GoPro off and put it in a
pocket or backpack, take the battery out and put it back in warm
pocket.

<p>Definitely worth buying an extra set of batteries. I’ve gone through
4+ on a good pow day.

<p>If you want to capture winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding,
sled dog racing etc., don’t waste your hard earned money on a Go Pro.

<p>You also see people putting it in a <a href="https://youtu.be/9SnPMeXVK3E">foam cover</a>
or others <a href="https://youtu.be/WK6oi7x_sNU">storing it in a bag</a> with <a href="https://youtu.be/eeI7bTvlXyg">hand
or feet warmers</a> when not in use.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-default-case" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-problem-with-the-default-case"><span>The problem with the default case</span></a></h2>
<p>I was actually surprised the first time I mounted the GoPro on my
helmet and I saw it die that fast. In the past I’ve used that same GoPro
hand-held, an I remember being able to shoot quite a lot, and still had
some battery left at the end of a ski day.</p>
<p>So what could be the culprit? Sure when it’s mounted on my helmet I tend
to leave it outside a bit more, whereas before I would store it in my
pocket when it’s not recording, but I’ve made a habit of taking it off
my helmet and putting it in my pocket during the lifts too, and still
had the same issues.</p>
<p>I’ve tried different pockets, jacket pocket, pants pocket, internal
pocket, but it wouldn’t make much difference. It was always dead after a
few hours of being outside, regardless if I was recording a lot or
keeping it in my pocket most of the time.</p>
<p>One day, I’ve even kept the GoPro in my pants pocket (turned out to be
the warmest) for an hour or two before first using it, and it was
<strong>already dead</strong> when I tried to record! WTF?</p>
<p>So I decided to <strong>try something</strong> and just use it hand-held like I used
to in the previous years, to see if my battery degraded significantly
over time or something. <strong>Turned out it performed great</strong> and I could
shoot plenty of hand-held shots the whole day without it dying at any
point!</p>
<p>Then I realized: the <em>only</em> difference between that day where it died in
my pocket before I even use it, and that time where I could record
hand-held all day, was <strong>the plastic case</strong>.</p>
<p>When I plan to use it hand-held only, I don’t put it in the black
plastic case that allows me to mount it.</p>
<ul>
<li>GoPro without case stored in pocket all day: <strong>full battery</strong>.</li>
<li>GoPro with case stored in pocket all day: <strong>battery dead after a
couple hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily if you have a newer GoPro, you don’t need a case to mount it
anymore, so this shouldn’t be as much of a problem. But if using one of
the GoPro that can only be mounted with a case, it’s a deal breaker!</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-super-suit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introducing-the-super-suit"><span>Introducing the Super Suit</span></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX">Super Suit</a>, alias “protection + dive
housing” and now renamed to <a href="https://amzn.to/3LMDaaa">“protective housing + waterproof case”</a>
for the newer models, is a transparent waterproof case for your GoPro.</p>
<figure class="center">
  <img alt="GoPro Super Suit" src="../../img/2022/05/gopro-super-suit.jpg">
</figure>
<p>It’s designed to be used for diving under water, but as
<a href="https://www.hardcoresledder.com/threads/gopro-camera-stops-in-cold-weather.620282/post-20359482">some users</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/pXfNA-xqETA">pointed out</a>, it does a great job at
protecting from the cold too. It seems this is a very little known trick
for this problem!</p>
<p>I <a href="https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX">ordered one</a> and was shocked of the
difference it made. <strong>I was no longer running out of battery during the
day.</strong></p>
<p>I could record as much as I wanted at any time of the day and the GoPro
was always there and had plenty of battery life!</p>
<p>I don’t record necessary <em>a lot</em> while I ski: between 30 minutes to 2
hours of content during a 6 hours ski day. Still, <strong>before the Super
Suit, the GoPro would die in the first 2 hours of skiing</strong>, regardless
of whether it was recording or stored in my pocket the whole time.</p>
<p>After the Super Suit, I can not only record <strong>over 2 hours of content</strong>,
but I can do so <strong>over the course of the whole day</strong>, as long as I keep
it in my pocket when it’s not recording!</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-audio" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#impact-on-audio"><span>Impact on audio</span></a></h2>
<p>One of the known downsides of the waterproof housing is that it muffles
the audio. It <em>does</em> sound like it’s inside a hermetic case.</p>
<p>This is a problem especially for voice: my own voice is somewhat audible
although not super crisp, but we can barely hear people talking around
me. This leads to some scenes where it sounds like I’m talking alone. 😂</p>
<p>But to be honest my HERO5 built-in audio has never been great, so if I
want to record somewhat usable vocals, I need to bring a real microphone
anyways. It seems that a lavalier microphone placed <em>inside</em> the collar
of a ski jacket is fantastic at recording your voice while skiing,
although I’ve never tried myself.</p>
<p>For the ambient sound though, I’ve found the muffled sound of the Super
Suit <strong>perfect to cancel the wind while skiing</strong>, so that we just hear
the skis gliding on the snow. This is in fact <strong>much better</strong> than what
we would otherwise get with the default case or no case (mostly wind,
skis not so much), and is actually usable as is!</p>
<p>I’ve also seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/pXfNA-xqETA">this video</a> a setup
where they drilled tiny holes in the Super Suit around the different
GoPro microphones locations, and covered them with a wind muff. It seems
to give pretty solid results, but I don’t have the tools to do that
myself, and I guess I like that I can actually use my Super Suit for
diving if I want to. 😄</p>
<h2 id="in-short" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-short"><span>In short</span></a></h2>
<p>GoPro dies in cold weather?</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a Super Suit, <a href="https://amzn.to/3wP6ZkX">Super Suit</a>,
alias <a href="https://amzn.to/3LMDaaa">“protective housing + waterproof case”</a>
for newer models.</li>
<li>Keep the GoPro in your warmest pocket while not recording, don’t let
it turned off mounted on your helmet all day!</li>
<li>Record voices with a lavalier microphone if you need quality dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope those tips help you to record more cool content while you’re
outside in the cold winter! If you found this post useful, you might also
