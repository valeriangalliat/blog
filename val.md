## About

I'm from **Grenoble**, in the beautiful French Alps, and currently
living in **Squamish, Canada**.

I write on this blog about **computers and programming**, but also about
**music**, **photography**, **video**, **brewing**, and anything else I
find useful and worth sharing.

---

One of my favorite things in life is summiting mountains, whether it's
hiking, rock climbing or skiing. I usually bring a [beer][brewing] at
the top and I often [take a picture of it][beer]. I love [taking pictures][photography].

[photography]: https://photography.codejam.info/

You’ll often see me riding bikes, whether it's [with][motorcycle] or
[without][bike] an engine.

I'm addicted to music, and when I'm not listening to some, it's more
likely because I'm [playing][channel].

I also happen to be a software developer, specialized in
backend and infrastructure. Currently working at [Arcade], and
previously at [Hookdeck].
