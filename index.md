Hey, I'm Val<small>,</small> <small>welcome to my blog!</small>
===============================================================

I'm passionate software developer, and as importantly, an amateur
musician, photograph, videographer, brewer and climber.

You'll find on this blog writings about the things that I care about and
feel like are worth sharing, as well as links to the different platforms
where I create content.
