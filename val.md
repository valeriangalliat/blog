## About

I'm from Grenoble, in the beautiful French Alps, and currently living in
Montreal, Canada.

One of my favorite things in life is summiting mountains, whether it's
hiking, rock climbing or skiing. I usually bring a beer at the summit
(possibly [homebrewed](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/sans-pression)),
which I not only love drinking, but also [taking pictures of][beer]. But
it's [not just about beer][photography], I like taking pictures in
general.

You’ll often see me riding bikes, whether it's [with][motorcycle] or
[without][bike] an engine.

I'm addicted to music, and when I'm not listening to some, it's more
likely because I'm [playing][channel].

I also happen to be an independent software developer, specialized in
backend and infrastructure. Previously, I was working at [Sportlogiq],
and before that, [Busbud].
