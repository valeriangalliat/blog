## About

I'm from **Grenoble**, in the beautiful French Alps, and currently
living in **Squamish, Canada**.

I write on this blog about **computers and programming**, but also about
**music**, **photography**, **video** and anything else I find useful
and worth sharing.

My favorite thing in life is summiting mountains, whether it's trail
running, rock climbing or [skiing].

You’ll often see me riding bikes, mostly [gravel] and MTB, but also
[motorcycles] occasionally.

I'm addicted to music, and when I'm not listening to some, it's more
likely because I'm [playing][channel].

I also happen to be a software developer, specialized in backend and
infrastructure. Currently working at [Arcade], and
previously at [Hookdeck].
