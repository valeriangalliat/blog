<p>This blog has been hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
for a while, but I was getting frustrated of not having any idea of the
traffic it was getting, and I was really curious to find out.</p>
<p>The only way to get traffic insights on GitHub pages is through
client-side analytics scripts, which is technically very unreliable, and
I‚Äôd rather not get any data than getting data that I cannot trust, and
which on top of that negatively impacts the performance of my site.</p>
<p>What I want is raw access to HTTP logs, which is the only proper source
of truth for this.</p>
<p>In the first part of this series, I‚Äôll compare different free static
hosting services and their options to get access to server-side
analytics or logs. Then, I‚Äôll show you <a href="vercel-custom-log-drain.html">in the second part</a>
how to retrieve logs on a Vercel app, which is the only service I found
to provide HTTP logs as part of their free offer!</p>
<h2 id="github-pages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#github-pages"><span>GitHub Pages</span></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is the easiest option to host
a static website for free, especially if you‚Äôre already working with
GitHub, but it doesn‚Äôt have an option to access HTTP logs.</p>
<p>The only method they document is using Google Analytics or a similar
script, but that‚Äôs not an acceptable solution to me. Let‚Äôs move on.</p>
<h2 id="netlify" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#netlify"><span>Netlify</span></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is my next favorite way to deploy a
static website. They also have a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">Netlify Analytics</a>,
product, an analytics platform based on server logs, which is exactly
what I want!</p>
<p>As they point out in their marketing page, it‚Äôs ‚Äúdata right from the
source of truth‚Äù, it‚Äôs got ‚Äúbetter performance‚Äù, ‚Äúmore accurate
numbers‚Äù, ‚Äúbetter privacy‚Äù and gives you access to extra metrics you can
only get on the server side.</p>
<p>To me this the only proper way to get traffic analytics on the web.</p>
<p>But they price that feature at $9 per month per site, which to be honest
is pretty decent if you have a website that‚Äôs generating some cash, but
my blog is not and my current budget is closer to $0.</p>
<p>And sadly, if not interested in the full blown analytics product,
there‚Äôs no way to <a href="https://answers.netlify.com/t/download-raw-server-access-logs/6586">only get the raw server logs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cloudflare"><span>Cloudflare</span></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> also has a free static hosting
offer. They‚Äôve got a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare Analytics</a>
product, but the free version is only powered by a client-side script,
which as we saw earlier, is useless.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the option to have analytics based on server logs starts with
the ‚Äúpro‚Äù plan that‚Äôs $20 per month. Too much for me.</p>
<p>They also offer <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-logs/">Cloudflare Logs</a>
which seems like it would at least give access to raw HTTP logs, but the
pricing is not mentioned and you need to contact their sales department
to maybe get access to it. Doesn‚Äôt look good.</p>
<h2 id="render" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#render"><span>Render</span></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> is another service with free static
hosting, and a it‚Äôs a very well built product. Simple and efficient. Out
of all the websites in this list, it‚Äôs the one with my favorite UI so
far. Gets shit done, no bullshit. üòç</p>
<p>I especially love the fact that they allow to configure any public Git
URL to pull from, without forcing you to connect with GitHub or another
hosted Git provider through OAuth like it‚Äôs the case with <a href="#vercel">Vercel</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, while you can <a href="https://render.com/docs/log-streams">configure a syslog drain</a>,
it only forward application logs and doesn‚Äôt include edge load balancer
HTTP logs, which is the only thing I care about.</p>
<h2 id="google-cloud-free-tier-vm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#google-cloud-free-tier-vm"><span>Google Cloud free tier VM</span></a></h2>
<p>While it‚Äôs very different from the other managed services I mention in
this list, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#compute">Google Cloud</a>
allows you to run a <code>e2-micro</code> instance constantly for free.</p>
<p>The <code>e2-micro</code> instance has access to 0.25 vCPU and can burst up to 2
vCPUs. It‚Äôs got 1 GB of RAM, and you‚Äôre allowed up to 30 GB of storage
for free. You can even assign it a static IP that will stay free as long
as it‚Äôs in use.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a pretty underpowered machine but will be way fine for serving
static websites, for example with nginx, as long as it doesn‚Äôt have a
ridiculous amount of traffic.</p>
<p>The only caveat is that you still have to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing">pay for traffic</a>.</p>
<p>Ingress traffic is free (data going in the VM), but you‚Äôll have to pay
for egress traffic (data going out of the VM). In other words, this
means that someone uploading a large file to your VM will be nearly
free, but serving a large file to someone will impact your billing.</p>
<p>Typically this is low enough to be negligible, but Google will be happy
to charge your credit card for $0.03 every month.</p>
<p>And because <em>you‚Äôre the server</em>, you can do whatever the fuck you want,
like logging HTTP traffic to <code>/var/log</code>.</p>
<p>This solution requires a bit of system administration knowledge, but if
like me, you find it to be exciting and a lot of fun, it‚Äôs definitely a
good solution. That being said you‚Äôll also be responsible of managing
the VM, keeping it up-to-date, and fixing any issue that might happen
with it, otherwise you website might get some downtime.</p>
<h2 id="vercel" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vercel"><span>Vercel</span></a></h2>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> also has free static hosting. Yay!</p>
<p>They even have a <a href="https://vercel.com/analytics">Vercel Analytics</a>
product, but it‚Äôs mostly focused on performance, and the data is
captured on the client side. Makes sense for performance data, but not
what I want.</p>
<p>They also have <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/logs">logs</a>, which
can even be <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/logs#persistence">persisted</a>,
through <a href="https://vercel.com/integrations#logging">logging integrations</a>.</p>
<p>This is great, but the whole point I‚Äôm doing this comparison is because
I want a <em>free</em> hosting with logs. If I‚Äôm not willing to pay for
hosting, I‚Äôm not going to pay for Logtrail, Sematext, Datadog or LogDNA. üòÜ</p>
<p>The good news is that the logging integrations are built on top of <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#integrations/log-drains">log
drains</a>, and
Vercel allows to <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/integrations">create custom integrations</a>.
This means that we can create our own custom integration, and for
example, configure a log drain that forwards the logs to‚Ä¶ a <a href="#google-cloud-free-tier-vm">Google Cloud free tier VM</a>!</p>
<p>This is the best of both words, because Google Cloud won‚Äôt charge for
ingress (and sending data to it is indeed ingress), so we‚Äôll only pay
for the egress of our SSH session where we query the log files, but
that‚Äôs going to be negligible.</p>
<p>In <a href="vercel-custom-log-drain.html">the next post</a>, I‚Äôll show you how to set
up Vercel with a custom integration to forward logs to a Google Cloud VM
(or the log drain of your choice). See you there!</p>
