# Simple, boring and "dumb" code

After more than 10 years building websites, I've had my fare share of
frameworks, design patterns, bleeding edge libraries, compiling and
transpiling everything possible and new cool, revolutionary ways of
doing one thing or another.

While those kept me excited for many years, I ended up getting bored of
it, and incidentally started writing boring code.

What's boring code? There's tons of articles explaining that already, so
instead of writing another one, I'll list here the resources I gathered
over time about this topic.
