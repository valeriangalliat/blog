# ðŸ“– Blog

> My personal blog.

## Description

This repository contains the scripts to build my static blog, together
with the articles Markdown source.

Everything is built around a [makefile](Makefile). Markdown parsing is
done with the [markdown-it] library and a couple of plugins.

[markdown-it]: https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it

Everything in this repository is in the public domain, thanks to the
[Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/), but if you want to hack on this
project, you probably want to remove the content and keep only the
engine.

## Usage

You need Node.js and GNU `make` to build.

```sh
npm install
make -j8
```

This will create a `dist` directory that is setup to track the
`gh-pages` branch of this repository and contains the built site.

## Deploy

After building:

```
cd dist
git commit -am 'Build'
git push
```
