<h1>About the name</h1>
<p>I got <a href="https://www.codejam.info/">codejam.info</a> years ago, with the idea
to build a tech blog to share tips, thoughts and resources about code.</p>
<p>It took me a while to settle on a name for this blog, and CodeJam was my
favorite. I’m both a music and free software enthusiast, and to me, the
philosophy of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session">jam session</a> applied to code pretty much sums up my
approach to building free software, hence the name CodeJam.</p>
<p>Indeed, a jam session would allow a variable number of musicians that
don’t necessarily know each other and don’t have the same level, to play
together without extensive preparation other than a set of chords, a
tempo and a time signature, mostly just improvising.</p>
<p>My vision of building free software is pretty much the same, to
improvise code with whoever wants to participate, in order to build
something functional and beautiful<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. This could relate in some ways to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">bazaar model</a> of development.</p>
<p>I later learnt that this name was already used by Google, for the Google
Code Jam international programming competition, which is unfortunate,
but I kept that name since I still believe in the message it symbolizes,
and it took me long enough to find a name that I don’t want to go
through that process anytime soon.</p>
<p>It also turned out that with time, my interests shifted from being
solely centered on programming and I now use that same domain name to
share a number of different things that I’m passionate about, whether
it’s photography, music, sports, brewing and so on.</p>
