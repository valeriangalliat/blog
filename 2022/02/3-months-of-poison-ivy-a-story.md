# 3 months of poison ivy, a story ðŸŒ¿
February 25, 2022

Long story short, if you were walking through tall herbs in the woods,
removing weeds from your garden or anything like this, and a few days to
a week later **you get a itchy rash** somewhere on your body that was
exposed at the time, then it might be *poison ivy* (that is, if you live
in a part of the world where there's poison ivy, e.g. North America).

If it's bad enough that it doesn't go away with the typical
over-the-counter treatments, *insist to get an appointment with a real
dermatologist (regardless if we're in the middle of a global pandemic)
to get properly diagnosed and treated*. They might prescribe you a month
of oral steroids to properly get rid of it.

Or don't do that and experience a taste of hell for 3 months like I did.

## Things I learnt about poison ivy

* It's an innocent-looking plant.
* There's not always a sign to warn you it's around your path
  (especially if you like to walk off tracks).
* If you suspect you've been in contact with it, or if you've been in
  contact with a bunch of random plants in the wild really, **wash your
  hands ASAP, in a lake, a river of whatever**, that can help a lot and
  could save you a nightmare.
* That said poison ivy don't usually grow below knee or waist level so
  you shouldn't be that worried about it unless you're wearing shorts or
  putting your hands close to the ground.
* If you suspect a piece of clothing, gear or equipment has been in
  contact with poison ivy, wash it thoroughly as the "poison" usually
  stays on things it touched until washed with soap, and stays potent
  for up to two years (meaning that if you touch that thing again you'll
  get poison ivy again).
* Depending on how bad was the contact with the plant, steroid creams
  you can get at the pharmacy without prescription can be useless, and
  even the stronger creams you can get with a prescription won't
  necessarily work, that's why the dermatologist I ended up seeing after
  3 months told me she usually prescribe 1 month of oral steroid
  treatment for patients infected by poison ivy. You won't have to bear
  with the itchiness during that time plus it's pretty much guaranteed
  to fully get rid of it.

  The side effects steroids are feared for are only for long use
  (months), if a doctor tells you to put a cream for a few weeks to
  treat a condition, it's worth it.

## The story with timings

Back in May 2020, right after the first COVID confinement in Canada, I
go climb in a spot in the forest with my friend. I even recorded a vlog
that day!

Near the end of the day we decide to scale the hill we were close to to
get some views at the top, but since there wasn't a path we just crossed
through the woods. You can see that at 36 minutes in the video. There
were some steep parts at times that definitely required me to touch the
ground with my hands. I suspect that's where I got in contact with
poison ivy.

To make the matter worst, since we climbed all day and I hadn't climbed
in a while, my fingers and hands had many cuts on them by the time we
did that hike. And because my hands were hurt, I didn't like the idea of
putting them in water to wash them as we were near a river later on
(unlike my friend did, which probably saved him a lot of trouble), so I
only washed my hands hours later when I got home.

### June

A week later, my hands start itching in a way that's really unusual. I
wait a few days thinking it'll just go away but it gets worst. So I go
to the pharmacy where they tell me it's likely poison ivy, explain me
what it is because I've never heard of it at this point, and told me to
get an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to put every day for a week
or so.

For the whole month, I get on and off symptoms of itchiness, redness and
raised bumps over my hands. Sometimes it feels like it's going away and
sometimes it's getting worst. It made life quite challenging because
it's basically something that I was constantly concerned about!

### July

Early July, I have a call with an online doctor who tells me I need to
put a stronger steroid cream for at least 7 days, and prescribes me one.
No symptoms while I put the cream every morning, but sadly two days
after I stopped the treatment, I start to get symptoms again. They
get worst over time to the point where I decide to put the cream again
for 2 weeks this time. But again, as I stop the treatment, the symptoms
slowly creep back.

I call an online doctor again who tells me it might be some kind of
eczema, but I don't need to see a dermatologist just yet (even though I
kept asking to see a real doctor to get treated properly, I mean it's
been two months I'm dealing with this at that point). He tells me to put
moisturizing cream 4 times a day, and also prescribes me an even
stronger steroid cream, but I don't use it right away because I didn't
really like the idea to depend on steroids for my hands to feel normal.

Near the end of July the symptoms are still bad so I finally oblige to
put the steroids cream. Apparently for this kind short period usage,
[it's fine](https://www.doc2us.com/are-steroid-creams-harmful-the-unfounded-fear).
Another 2 weeks of putting the cream every morning.

### August

Guess what happens early August right after the 2 weeks treatment is
over? Yeap, itchiness comes back. And it gets pretty bad towards the
middle of the month. I don't know if I'm experiencing poison ivy rebound
one more time or if it's now steroid withdrawal symptom?

Another call with an online doctor who decides that I have *dyshidrotic
eczema* and finally agrees to send me to a proper dermatologist (thank
you). He also tells me to put a moisturizing cream specialized for
eczema (I used the [Cetaphil PRO](https://www.cetaphil.ca/product/cetaphil-pro-restoraderm-eczema-soothing-moisturizer))
and I can say it relieved the itching quite well in comparison to
cheaper moisturizers.

Finally he prescribes me an even stronger steroid cream
(mometasone) that I need to put every morning for 5 days, keeping it on
my hands for 20 minutes before rinsing it away. Not my favorite kind of
morning routine if you ask me.

On the 20th of August I finally get my dermatologist appointment, but by
this time the symptoms are not as bad as they were in the past. She
tells me it was definitely poison ivy and that the reason it lasted so
long for me was because the creams are not that good at treating it. She
normally prescribes 1 month of oral steroids for poison ivy treatment
which pretty much guarantees to get rid of it definitively (on top of
removing 100% of the annoying symptoms during that time). Good to know
if it ever happens to me again!

After that I kept using the moisturizing cream occasionally for a few
months as my skin was still dryer than usual, but itching was basically
gone and I could live a happy life again. Eventually I stopped the
moisturizer as my hands were fully back to normal.

## Conclusion

I already put the conclusion in the very beginning of this article
because I don't really think anyone cares about the rest of the story.
That was just some old notes I had, and I didn't want to just delete
them as I figured they might be useful.

Typically, I looked up online about this stuff every single day to
figure what was wrong with my hands, and it was hard to get an idea of
what treatment I needed and what to expect. Obviously this can vary a
lot but I think reading a concrete example like this one can help
getting an idea of what to expect, and especially not making the same
mistakes.

In this COVID world it can be hard to see a doctor in real life, but I
can't stress how important it is to meet a real professional to address
seriously this kind of issue, especially if they persist after the basic
pharmacy treatments or other suggestions found on the internet.
